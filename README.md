# Liver Cirrhosis Prediction

Authors: Sneha Jaikumar, Guning (Emily) Shen, Shefali Pai, Annabelle Jiang

Cirrhosis of the liver, or hepatic cirrhosis, is a debilitating condition that results in permanent scarring and liver failure. We explore the extent to which four different machine-learning models, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Neural Network, and XGBoost, can be used as a tool for predicting the survival of patients grappling with liver cirrhosis. Leveraging a dataset derived from a seminal Mayo Clinic study conducted between 1974 and 1984 on primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), we explore the potential of 17 clinical features as predictive indicators. We use the accuracy yielded by each model in addition to confusion matrices to reach a thorough conclusion on model performance and the impact this can have on cirrhosis prevention and treatment.
